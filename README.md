# Partitioning problem:

## Problem Statement

An arbitrary list of positive integers of any length and in any order
Determine if the list is partitionable or not. A partitioned list is one where it can be split into 2 sub-lists with equal sum. A sub-list can be any arbitrary (any set of numbers in any order) selection of numbers out of the parent list.

Enumerate the list of cases to solve to minimize execution time and provide the Order of the algorithm

Provide code showing the implementation in Python.

## Example:

List = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 = Partitionable 
List = 1,10,5,21,4 = Not Partitionable
List = 1,10,5,21,4,1 = Partitionable
